* While on vacation on Hawaii last year, you discovered a newfound passion for surfing. You have been trying to come up with a plan that will help you not just to return to Hawaii but also live there. You come up with an idea of opening a Surf n' Shake shop, that serves surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing, is an investor who will help with opening the shop. He wants to know more about whether there because of similar business that failed due to weather conditions. W. Avy would like you to perform analysis on weather dataset from Oahu, the Island where you would like to open your shop.

* W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We will help with the analysis of the dataset.

* added the precipitation and station to the queries for both June and December. we can see from the images above that the average precipitation for June is 14% while for December is 22%

* added the station to the query that helps us to select the station that has the best temperature and low chances of rain 

* further we can query other months to check the temperature and precipitations. As well we can also include wind in the query since that can affect surfing 

* Based on the temperature and precipitation analysis, Oahu Hawaii is the best location to open the Surf n' Shake shop since the temperature is very nice throughout the year and there is low chance of rain.
